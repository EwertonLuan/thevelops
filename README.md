# API with NodeJs, Mongodb and ReactJs 

### This project creates a website with a login page, signup, user information, data editing, password update, user delete and logout

we use [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) to create a Token Signing / Verification and store it in the localStorage for persiste authorization between sessions.

To encrypt the password we use [bcrypt](https://bycryp.com/).


## Installation and Usage

Prerequisites Backend: 
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) 

Prerequisites Frontend: 
* [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)

Into the folders backend and frontend, run the comand:
```sh
$ npm install 
```
 Start the React server, in the folder frontend with command:
 ```sh
 $ npm start
 ```
Start the server API in the folder backend with command:
 ```sh
 $ npm run dev
 ```
Satart the Mongodb
 ```sh
 $  mongod --dbpath /data/db
 ```
This comando will runing the projetc with the babel and nodemon.

[Babel.js](https://babeljs.io/) is a JavaScript compiler. He can transform a code written with ES6 specifications into something that Node.js can fully understand.
